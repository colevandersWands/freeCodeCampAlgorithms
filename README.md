## What is freeCodeCamp?

FreeCodeCamp is an open source website that is used to learn web development. They contain at the moment six certificates, responsive web design, javascript algorithms and data structures, front end libraries, data visualization, apis and microservices, and information security and quality assurance.

FreeCodeCamp has a very helpful, active community on their forum, and is a great place to start learning web development.
