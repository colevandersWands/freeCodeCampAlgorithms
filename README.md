## What is freeCodeCamp?

FreeCodeCamp is an open source website that is used to learn web development. They contain at the moment three certificates, the front end development certificate, the data visualization certificate, and the back end development certificate. However, there is a beta version that contains six certificates which will be released when the beta is stable. FreeCodeCamp has a very helpful, active community on their forum, and is a great place to start your web development learning journey.
